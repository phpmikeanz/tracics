# Login Troubleshooting Guide

## Issue: Infinite Loading During Login

### What Was Fixed

The login process was getting stuck in an infinite loading state due to several issues:

1. **Profile fetching was hanging** - Added timeout and better error handling
2. **Loading state wasn't being reset** - Added proper loading state management
3. **Auth state listener wasn't handling errors** - Added try/catch blocks
4. **No fallback for failed logins** - Added timeout and error recovery

### Changes Made

#### 1. Auth Context (`contexts/auth-context.tsx`)
- Added comprehensive logging throughout the auth flow
- Added timeout (10 seconds) for profile fetching to prevent hanging
- Improved error handling in auth state listener
- Added immediate profile fetching after successful login
- Better fallback to user metadata when profile fetch fails

#### 2. Login Form (`components/auth/login-form.tsx`)
- Added timeout (15 seconds) for login attempts
- Better error messages for timeouts
- Comprehensive error handling with try/catch

#### 3. App Page (`app/page.tsx`)
- Added auto-skip loading after 10 seconds
- Enhanced debug information

### How to Test the Fix

#### Step 1: Check Console Logs
1. Open Developer Tools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Try logging in
4. Look for these log patterns:

**Successful Login Flow:**
```
[LoginForm] Attempting login for: your-email@example.com
[Auth] Starting login for: your-email@example.com
[Auth] Login successful, user: [user-id]
[Auth] Fetching profile for user: [user-id]
[Auth] Profile found with role: student/faculty
[LoginForm] Login successful, redirecting...
```

**Failed Login Flow:**
```
[Auth] Login error: Invalid login credentials
[LoginForm] Login error: Invalid credentials or login timeout
```

#### Step 2: Test Different Scenarios

**Test 1: Valid Credentials**
- Use a valid email/password combination
- Should see successful login logs
- Should redirect to appropriate dashboard

**Test 2: Invalid Credentials**
- Use invalid email/password
- Should see error message within a few seconds
- Loading should stop and show error

**Test 3: Network Issues**
- Disconnect internet briefly during login
- Should timeout and show error message
- Loading should stop after 15 seconds max

#### Step 3: Check Debug Panel
After login, the debug panel should show:
- **User ID**: Actual UUID
- **Email**: Your email address
- **Role**: student or faculty (correct role)
- **Authenticated**: âœ“ Yes
- **Loading**: No

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue 1: Still Getting Infinite Loading
**Solution:**
1. Clear browser cache and cookies
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Verify Supabase configuration
4. Try the "Skip Loading" button to bypass

#### Issue 2: "Profile fetch timeout" Error
**Possible Causes:**
- Database connection issues
- RLS (Row Level Security) blocking access
- Profile table doesn't exist
- Network connectivity problems

**Solution:**
1. Check Supabase dashboard for database health
2. Verify RLS policies allow profile reading
3. Ensure profiles table exists with correct schema

#### Issue 3: Wrong Role Detection
**Symptoms:**
- Debug panel shows wrong role
- Wrong dashboard appears

**Solution:**
1. Check user_metadata in Supabase auth dashboard
2. Verify profile was created with correct role
3. Check signup process saved role correctly

### Manual Recovery Steps

If login is still stuck:

1. **Force Skip Loading**
   - Click "Skip Loading (Debug)" button
   - Or wait 10 seconds for auto-skip

2. **Clear Application Data**
   ```javascript
   // Run in browser console
   localStorage.clear();
   sessionStorage.clear();
   location.reload();
   ```

3. **Check Supabase Dashboard**
   - Verify user exists in Authentication
   - Check if profile exists in profiles table
   - Verify role is set correctly

### Environment Variables to Check

Ensure these are set correctly in your `.env.local`:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
```

### Production Deployment Notes

Before deploying to production:
1. Remove or hide the debug panel
2. Reduce timeout values if needed
3. Add proper error reporting/logging
4. Test with actual users and network conditions

### Getting Help

If issues persist:
1. Share the console logs from a failed login attempt
2. Include the debug panel information
3. Check Supabase dashboard for any errors
4. Verify your database schema matches the expected structure
