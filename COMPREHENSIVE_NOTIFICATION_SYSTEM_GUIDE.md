# 🔔 Comprehensive Notification System Guide

## ✅ **Complete Implementation**

I've implemented a comprehensive notification system that provides real-time notifications for both faculty and students based on their activities and roles.

## 🎯 **What Each Role Sees**

### **Faculty Notifications:**
- 📚 **Assignment Submissions** - When students submit assignments
- ⚠️ **Late Submissions** - When students submit assignments late
- 📊 **Quiz Completions** - When students complete quizzes with scores
- 👥 **Enrollment Requests** - When students request to enroll in courses
- ✅ **Enrollment Approvals** - When enrollment requests are approved/declined
- 🎓 **Direct Enrollments** - When faculty directly enroll students
- 📢 **Course Announcements** - When they create announcements

### **Student Notifications:**
- 📚 **Assignment Due Reminders** - When assignments are due soon
- ⚠️ **Urgent Due Dates** - When assignments are due in less than 24 hours
- 📝 **Quiz Available** - When new quizzes are published
- 🎯 **Quiz Completed** - When they complete quizzes
- ✅ **Assignment Submitted** - When they submit assignments
- 🎉 **Grades Posted** - When they receive grades for assignments/quizzes
- 👥 **Enrollment Requests** - When they request enrollment in courses
- 🎉 **Enrollment Approved** - When their enrollment is approved
- ❌ **Enrollment Declined** - When their enrollment is declined
- 🎓 **Direct Enrollment** - When faculty directly enrolls them
- 📢 **Course Announcements** - When faculty post announcements

## 🔧 **Implementation Details**

### **1. Core Notification System (`lib/comprehensive-notification-system.ts`)**

#### **Faculty Notification Functions:**
```typescript
// Notify faculty when student submits assignment
await notifyFacultyAssignmentSubmission(facultyId, studentId, assignmentId, courseId, isLate)

// Notify faculty when student completes quiz
await notifyFacultyQuizCompletion(facultyId, studentId, quizId, courseId, score, maxScore)

// Notify faculty when student requests enrollment
await notifyFacultyEnrollmentRequest(facultyId, studentId, courseId)

// Notify faculty when enrollment status changes
await notifyFacultyEnrollmentStatusChange(facultyId, studentId, courseId, status)
```

#### **Student Notification Functions:**
```typescript
// Notify student of assignment due date
await notifyStudentAssignmentDue(studentId, assignmentId, courseId, hoursUntilDue)

// Notify student when quiz is available
await notifyStudentQuizAvailable(studentId, quizId, courseId)

// Notify student when they receive a grade
await notifyStudentGrade(studentId, assignmentId, courseId, grade, maxGrade, isQuiz)

// Notify student of their own submission
await notifyStudentAssignmentSubmitted(studentId, assignmentId, courseId, isLate)

// Notify student of enrollment request
await notifyStudentEnrollmentRequest(studentId, courseId)

// Notify student of enrollment status
await notifyStudentEnrollmentStatus(studentId, courseId, status, facultyName)

// Notify student of direct enrollment
await notifyStudentDirectEnrollment(studentId, courseId, facultyName)
```

### **2. React Hook (`hooks/use-comprehensive-notifications.ts`)**

The hook provides easy integration with React components:

```typescript
const {
  notifications,
  unreadCount,
  loading,
  // Faculty functions
  notifyFacultyOfAssignmentSubmission,
  notifyFacultyOfQuizCompletion,
  createCourseAnnouncement,
  notifyFacultyOfEnrollmentRequest,
  notifyFacultyOfEnrollmentStatusChange,
  // Student functions
  notifyStudentOfAssignmentSubmission,
  notifyStudentOfQuizCompletion,
  notifyStudentOfAssignmentDue,
  notifyStudentOfQuizAvailable,
  notifyStudentOfGrade,
  notifyStudentOfEnrollmentRequest,
  notifyStudentOfEnrollmentStatus,
  notifyStudentOfDirectEnrollment
} = useComprehensiveNotifications()
```

### **3. Updated Notification Center**

The notification center now shows:
- **Faculty**: "Student Activities & Course Updates"
- **Students**: "Your Assignments, Quizzes & Course Updates"
- **Role-specific styling** and descriptions
- **Real-time updates** every 30 seconds

## 🚀 **How to Integrate**

### **In Assignment Submission Components:**

```typescript
import { useComprehensiveNotifications } from "@/hooks/use-comprehensive-notifications"

function AssignmentSubmissionForm() {
  const { notifyStudentOfAssignmentSubmission } = useComprehensiveNotifications()
  
  const handleSubmit = async (assignmentData) => {
    // Submit assignment to database
    const result = await submitAssignment(assignmentData)
    
    if (result.success) {
      // Notify student of their submission
      await notifyStudentOfAssignmentSubmission(
        assignmentData.assignmentId,
        assignmentData.courseId,
        assignmentData.isLate
      )
      
      // Notify faculty (this would typically be done by backend)
      // await notifyFacultyOfAssignmentSubmission(...)
    }
  }
}
```

### **In Quiz Completion Components:**

```typescript
function QuizCompletion() {
  const { notifyStudentOfQuizCompletion } = useComprehensiveNotifications()
  
  const handleQuizSubmit = async (quizData) => {
    // Submit quiz to database
    const result = await submitQuiz(quizData)
    
    if (result.success) {
      // Notify student of completion
      await notifyStudentOfQuizCompletion(
        quizData.quizId,
        quizData.courseId,
        quizData.score,
        quizData.maxScore
      )
    }
  }
}
```

### **In Grade Assignment Components:**

```typescript
function GradeAssignment() {
  const { notifyStudentOfGrade } = useComprehensiveNotifications()
  
  const handleGradeAssignment = async (gradeData) => {
    // Save grade to database
    const result = await saveGrade(gradeData)
    
    if (result.success) {
      // Notify student of their grade
      await notifyStudentOfGrade(
        gradeData.assignmentId,
        gradeData.courseId,
        gradeData.grade,
        gradeData.maxGrade,
        gradeData.isQuiz
      )
    }
  }
}
```

### **In Course Announcement Components:**

```typescript
function CreateAnnouncement() {
  const { createCourseAnnouncement } = useComprehensiveNotifications()
  
  const handleCreateAnnouncement = async (announcementData) => {
    // Save announcement to database
    const result = await saveAnnouncement(announcementData)
    
    if (result.success) {
      // Notify all students in the course
      await createCourseAnnouncement(
        announcementData.courseId,
        announcementData.title,
        announcementData.message
      )
    }
  }
}
```

### **In Enrollment Request Components:**

```typescript
function EnrollmentRequest() {
  const { notifyStudentOfEnrollmentRequest } = useComprehensiveNotifications()
  
  const handleRequestEnrollment = async (courseId) => {
    // Save enrollment request to database
    const result = await requestEnrollment(courseId)
    
    if (result.success) {
      // Notify student of their request
      await notifyStudentOfEnrollmentRequest(courseId)
    }
  }
}
```

### **In Enrollment Approval Components:**

```typescript
function EnrollmentApproval() {
  const { 
    notifyFacultyOfEnrollmentRequest,
    notifyStudentOfEnrollmentStatus 
  } = useComprehensiveNotifications()
  
  const handleApproveEnrollment = async (studentId, courseId, status) => {
    // Update enrollment status in database
    const result = await updateEnrollmentStatus(studentId, courseId, status)
    
    if (result.success) {
      // Notify faculty of status change
      await notifyFacultyOfEnrollmentStatusChange(studentId, courseId, status)
      
      // Notify student of status
      await notifyStudentOfEnrollmentStatus(courseId, status, facultyName)
    }
  }
}
```
