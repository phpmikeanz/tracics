-- PostgreSQL Trigger and Function for Automatic Quiz Grading Sync
-- This automatically updates quiz_attempts.score and status when quiz_question_grades changes

-- 1. Create the trigger function
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION sync_quiz_attempt_score()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
DECLARE
    attempt_id_to_update UUID;
    total_score NUMERIC := 0;

-- 2. Create triggers for INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS trigger_sync_quiz_score_insert ON quiz_question_grades;
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS trigger_sync_quiz_score_update ON quiz_question_grades;
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS trigger_sync_quiz_score_delete ON quiz_question_grades;

-- Trigger for INSERT operations
CREATE TRIGGER trigger_sync_quiz_score_insert
    AFTER INSERT ON quiz_question_grades
    FOR EACH ROW
    EXECUTE FUNCTION sync_quiz_attempt_score();

-- Trigger for UPDATE operations
CREATE TRIGGER trigger_sync_quiz_score_update
    AFTER UPDATE ON quiz_question_grades
    FOR EACH ROW
    EXECUTE FUNCTION sync_quiz_attempt_score();

-- Trigger for DELETE operations
CREATE TRIGGER trigger_sync_quiz_score_delete
    AFTER DELETE ON quiz_question_grades
    FOR EACH ROW
    EXECUTE FUNCTION sync_quiz_attempt_score();

-- 3. Create a function to manually sync all quiz attempts (useful for existing data)
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION sync_all_quiz_attempts()
RETURNS TABLE(
    attempt_id UUID,
    old_score NUMERIC,
    new_score NUMERIC,
    old_status TEXT,
    new_status TEXT,

    FOR attempt_record IN 
        SELECT DISTINCT qa.id, qa.quiz_id, qa.score as old_score, qa.status as old_status, qa.answers
        FROM quiz_attempts qa
        WHERE EXISTS (
            SELECT 1 FROM quiz_question_grades qqg 
            WHERE qqg.attempt_id = qa.id
        )
    LOOP
        -- Calculate auto-graded score
        SELECT COALESCE(SUM(qq.points), 0) INTO auto_score
        FROM quiz_questions qq

        AND qq.type IN ('multiple_choice', 'true_false')
        AND attempt_record.answers->>qq.id::text = qq.correct_answer;

        FROM quiz_question_grades
        WHERE attempt_id = attempt_record.id;
        
        -- Calculate total score
        total_score := auto_score + manual_score;
        
        -- Update the quiz attempt
        UPDATE quiz_attempts 
        SET 
            score = total_score,
            status = 'graded'
        WHERE id = attempt_record.id;
        
        -- Return the result
        attempt_id := attempt_record.id;
        old_score := attempt_record.old_score;
        new_score := total_score;

        manual_graded_points := manual_score;
        
        RETURN NEXT;
    END LOOP;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

-- 4. Test the trigger with a sample operation
-- (This is commented out to avoid actually inserting test data)
/*
-- Test the trigger by inserting a manual grade
INSERT INTO quiz_question_grades (
    attempt_id,
    question_id,
    points_awarded,
    feedback,
    graded_by
) VALUES (
    'your-attempt-id-here',
    'your-question-id-here',
    5,
    'Test feedback',
    'your-user-id-here'
);
*/

-- 5. Verify the triggers were created
SELECT 
    trigger_name,
    event_manipulation,
    action_timing,
    action_statement
FROM information_schema.triggers 
WHERE event_object_table = 'quiz_question_grades'
AND trigger_name LIKE '%sync_quiz_score%'
ORDER BY trigger_name;

-- 6. Run the sync function for existing data
SELECT * FROM sync_all_quiz_attempts();

-- 7. Verify the function works by checking updated records
SELECT 
    'Sync Verification' as check_type,
    COUNT(*) as total_attempts,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN status = 'graded' THEN 1 END) as graded_attempts,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN status = 'completed' THEN 1 END) as completed_attempts,
    AVG(score) as average_score
FROM quiz_attempts qa
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM quiz_question_grades qqg 
    WHERE qqg.attempt_id = qa.id
);
