    FOR EACH ROW
    WHEN (NEW.status = 'submitted' AND (OLD.status IS NULL OR OLD.status != 'submitted'))
    EXECUTE FUNCTION notify_faculty_assignment_submission();

-- Quiz completion trigger
CREATE TRIGGER trigger_notify_faculty_quiz_completion

3. **Check database logs** - Look for trigger errors in Supabase logs

### **If Notification Bell Doesn't Update**
1. **Check frontend code** - Ensure notification bell is using correct API
2. **Check polling interval** - Ensure auto-refresh is enabled
3. **Check user permissions** - Ensure users can read notifications

## 📊 **Monitoring**

### **Check System Status**
```sql
-- Check if all triggers are active
SELECT * FROM check_notification_system_status();

-- Check recent notifications
SELECT 
    n.title,
    n.message,
    n.type,
    n.created_at,
    p.full_name as user_name
FROM notifications n
JOIN profiles p ON p.id = n.user_id
ORDER BY n.created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Check unread notifications by user
SELECT 
    p.full_name,
    COUNT(*) as unread_count
FROM notifications n
JOIN profiles p ON p.id = n.user_id
WHERE n.read = false
GROUP BY p.id, p.full_name
