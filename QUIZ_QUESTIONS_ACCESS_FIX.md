# Quiz Questions Access Fix

## Problem
Students were seeing "No Questions Available" message in quizzes even when instructors had added questions. The issue was related to Row Level Security (RLS) policies and enrollment checks.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **RLS Policy Issue**: The existing RLS policy for `quiz_questions` didn't properly check if the quiz was published, allowing access to draft quizzes.

2. **Redundant Enrollment Check**: The `getQuizQuestions` function was doing its own enrollment check, which was redundant and potentially causing conflicts with RLS policies.

3. **Poor Error Messages**: Students weren't getting clear information about why they couldn't access quiz questions.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated RLS Policy (`scripts/update_quiz_questions_rls_policy.sql`)
- **Before**: Students could access questions from any quiz in courses they were enrolled in
- **After**: Students can only access questions from **published** or **closed** quizzes in courses they're enrolled in and approved for
- **Faculty**: Can still access questions from any quiz in their own courses (any status)

### 2. Simplified `getQuizQuestions` Function (`lib/quizzes.ts`)
- Removed redundant enrollment check that was potentially causing conflicts
- Added explicit check to ensure students can only access published/closed quizzes
- Improved error logging to identify RLS policy issues
- Better error messages for debugging

### 3. Enhanced User Experience (`components/quizzes/quiz-taking.tsx`)
- Improved error message to explain possible reasons why questions aren't available
- Added helpful guidance for students
- Better debugging information for technical issues

## Files Modified

1. `lib/quizzes.ts` - Simplified enrollment check, added quiz status validation
2. `components/quizzes/quiz-taking.tsx` - Enhanced error messages and user guidance
3. `scripts/update_quiz_questions_rls_policy.sql` - New RLS policy
4. `scripts/debug_student_quiz_access.sql` - Debug script for troubleshooting
5. `scripts/test_quiz_questions_access.sql` - Test script to verify the fix

## How to Apply the Fix

1. **Run the RLS policy update**:
   ```sql
   -- Execute the contents of scripts/update_quiz_questions_rls_policy.sql
   ```

2. **The code changes are already applied** - no additional deployment needed

3. **Test the fix**:
   - Create a quiz with questions as an instructor
   - Publish the quiz
   - Try to access the quiz as a student
   - Verify that questions are now visible

## Verification Steps

1. **Check RLS Policy**: Run `scripts/test_quiz_questions_access.sql` to verify the policy is working
2. **Test Student Access**: Have a student try to access a published quiz with questions
3. **Test Faculty Access**: Verify faculty can still access questions from draft quizzes
4. **Test Enrollment**: Ensure only approved students can access questions

## Expected Behavior After Fix

- ✅ Students can see questions from published/closed quizzes in courses they're enrolled in and approved for
- ✅ Students cannot see questions from draft quizzes
- ✅ Faculty can see questions from any quiz in their own courses
- ✅ Clear error messages when access is denied
- ✅ Proper debugging information for troubleshooting

## Troubleshooting

If students still can't access quiz questions:

1. **Check Enrollment Status**: Ensure the student is enrolled and approved for the course
2. **Check Quiz Status**: Ensure the quiz is published (not draft)
3. **Check RLS Policy**: Run the test script to verify the policy is active
4. **Check Console Logs**: Look for RLS policy errors in the browser console
5. **Run Debug**: Use the debug button in the quiz interface for detailed information

## Related Issues

This fix addresses the core issue where students couldn't see quiz questions even when instructors had added them. The problem was primarily due to RLS policy configuration and redundant enrollment checks.
