# Cancel Button Fix Complete

## Summary

All cancel buttons throughout the application now have proper onClick functionality implemented. The fix ensures that cancel buttons properly close their respective dialogs and reset form states as expected.

## Changes Made

### 1. `components/quiz-management.tsx`
   - **Added state**: Created `isAddQuestionDialogOpen` state variable to control the Add Question dialog
   - **Fixed Add Question Cancel button** (Line 542-543): Now properly closes the dialog with `onClick={() => setIsAddQuestionDialogOpen(false)}`
   - **Fixed Settings Cancel button** (Line 689): Now properly closes the edit dialog with `onClick={() => setIsEditDialogOpen(false)}`
   - **Added automatic closure**: Dialog now closes after successfully adding a question

### 2. `components/assignments/assignment-management.tsx`
   - **Simplified Cancel button** (Lines 826-833): Changed from resetting form fields to simply closing the dialog with `onClick={() => setIsEditDialogOpen(false)}`
   - This provides a cleaner user experience - cancel means close the dialog without changes

### 3. `components/quizzes/quiz-management.tsx` (Database version)
   - **Already working**: The edit question dialog already had a proper `cancelEditQuestion` function
   - **Already working**: The quiz settings cancel button properly closes both the date picker and edit dialog
