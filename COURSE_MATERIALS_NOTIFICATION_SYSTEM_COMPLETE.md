## ✅ **Feature Successfully Implemented**

I've successfully added course materials notifications to your LMS system! Now when faculty uploads new course materials, students will automatically receive notifications.

### **1. Course Materials Notifications**
- **Automatic notifications** when faculty uploads new course materials
- **Smart material type detection** (document, video, link, assignment, quiz)
- **Required material indicators** in notifications

### **2. Enhanced Notification Types**
- Added `'course_material'` to notification types
- Updated all notification interfaces and functions
- Integrated with existing notification system

### **3. Debug and Testing Tools**

): Promise<boolean>
```

**Features:**
- ✅ Notifies all enrolled students in the course

- ✅ **Bulk notification testing** for course materials
