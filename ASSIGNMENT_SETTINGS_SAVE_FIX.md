# 🔧 Assignment Settings Save Fix

## ✅ **Issue Resolved**

Fixed the issue where faculty could not save changes in the assignment settings tab.

## 🐛 **Root Cause**

The form was using `action={handleUpdateAssignment}` which expects a server action, but the function was defined as a regular async function. This caused the form submission to fail silently.

## 🔧 **Solution Applied**

### **1. Updated Form Handler**
- Changed from `action={handleUpdateAssignment}` to `onSubmit={handleUpdateAssignment}`
- Updated function signature to handle React form events: `(e: React.FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>)`
- Added `e.preventDefault()` to prevent default form submission

### **2. Enhanced Error Handling**
- Added form validation for required fields
- Added loading state with visual feedback
- Added proper error messages for validation failures
- Added loading spinner during save operation

### **3. Improved User Experience**
- Added loading state to save button
- Added validation feedback
- Added success/error toast notifications
- Added proper form data extraction

## 📝 **Code Changes**

### **Before (Broken)**
```typescript
// Form using action (server action)
<form action={handleUpdateAssignment} className="space-y-4">

// Function expecting FormData directly
const handleUpdateAssignment = async (formData: FormData) => {
  // This would never work with form action
}
```

### **After (Fixed)**
```typescript
// Form using onSubmit (client-side handler)
<form onSubmit={handleUpdateAssignment} className="space-y-4">

// Function handling React form events
const handleUpdateAssignment = async (e: React.FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>) => {
  e.preventDefault()
  const formData = new FormData(e.currentTarget)
  // Proper form data extraction and validation
}
```

## ✅ **Features Added**

1. **Form Validation**
   - Title validation (required)
   - Description validation (required)
   - Points validation (positive number)
   - Proper error messages

2. **Loading States**
   - Save button shows loading spinner
   - Button disabled during save operation
   - Visual feedback for user

3. **Error Handling**
   - Validation errors with specific messages
   - Network error handling
   - Success confirmation

4. **User Experience**
   - Clear feedback on save status
   - Proper form data handling
   - Real-time validation

## 🎯 **What Works Now**
