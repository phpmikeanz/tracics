# Quiz Questions Issue Fix Summary

## Problem Description
The quiz system was showing "No Questions Available" with an empty questions array when combining multiple question types (multiple choice, true/false, essay, short answer). Individual question types worked fine, but mixing them caused errors.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. Syntax Error in `getQuizQuestions` Function
**File:** `lib/quizzes.ts`
**Issue:** Missing opening brace after `try` statement in the `getQuizQuestions` function
**Fix:** Added the missing opening brace

### 2. Missing Form Fields for Short Answer and Essay Questions
**File:** `components/quizzes/quiz-management.tsx`
**Issue:** The form was missing the `correct_answer` field for short_answer and essay question types
**Fix:** Added a textarea field for correct_answer when question type is short_answer or essay

### 3. TypeScript Type Mismatch
**File:** `lib/types.ts`
**Issue:** The `correct_answer` field was defined as required (`string`) in TypeScript types but the database allows it to be null
**Fix:** Updated all type definitions to make `correct_answer` optional (`string | null`)

### 4. Form Reset Logic
**File:** `components/quizzes/quiz-management.tsx`
**Issue:** When changing question types, the form wasn't properly resetting the `correct_answer` and `options` fields
**Fix:** Updated the question type change handler to reset these fields appropriately

## Files Modified

1. **lib/quizzes.ts**
   - Fixed syntax error in `getQuizQuestions` function

2. **components/quizzes/quiz-management.tsx**
   - Added correct_answer field for short_answer and essay questions
   - Updated question type change handler to reset fields properly
   - Made correct_answer optional in CreateQuestionForm interface

3. **lib/types.ts**
   - Updated quiz_questions Row, Insert, and Update types to make correct_answer optional

4. **scripts/test_quiz_questions_fix.sql** (new)
   - Created test script to verify the fixes work correctly

## Testing

To test the fixes:

1. Run the test script: `scripts/test_quiz_questions_fix.sql`
2. Try creating a quiz with mixed question types:
   - Multiple choice question
   - True/false question
   - Short answer question
   - Essay question
3. Verify that all questions are saved and retrieved correctly
4. Test that students can access and take the quiz

## Expected Behavior After Fix

- All question types can be created successfully
- Questions are properly saved to the database
- Students can access quizzes with mixed question types
- The questions array is populated correctly when loading quizzes
- No more "No Questions Available" errors when combining question types

## Database Schema Notes

The `quiz_questions` table correctly allows `correct_answer` to be null, which is appropriate for essay questions where there might not be a single "correct" answer, or for questions where the correct answer is used only for reference during manual grading.
