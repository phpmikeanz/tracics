# üîß Assignment Settings Save Testing Guide

## üêõ **Issue**: Assignment Settings Form Not Saving

The assignment settings form is not triggering the save function when clicking "Save Changes". Here's a comprehensive testing guide to identify and fix the issue.

## üß™ **Testing Steps**

### **Step 1: Basic Form Submission Test**
1. Open the assignment settings dialog
2. Open browser Developer Tools (F12)
3. Go to Console tab
4. Click "Save Changes" button
5. **Expected Console Output:**
   ```
   Form submitted!
   Form preventDefault called
   Starting assignment update for: [assignment-id]
   ```

### **Step 2: Test Form Submission Manually**
1. In the assignment settings dialog
2. Click the "Test Form" button
3. **Expected Console Output:**
   ```
   Testing form submission manually...
   Form found, triggering submit
   Form submitted!
   Form preventDefault called
   ```

### **Step 3: Test Direct Save**
1. In the assignment settings dialog
2. Click the "Direct Save" button
3. **Expected Console Output:**
   ```
   Direct save test...
   Direct save data: { title: "...", description: "...", max_points: ..., due_date: "..." }
   updateAssignment called with: { id: "...", updates: {...} }
   Assignment updated successfully: {...}
   ```

### **Step 4: Test Database Connection**
1. In the assignment settings dialog
2. Click the "Test DB" button
3. **Expected Console Output:**
   ```
   Testing database connection...
   Database test result: { data: [...], error: null }
   ```

## üîç **Debugging Information**

### **What Each Test Button Does:**

1. **"Test DB" Button**: Tests database connectivity and authentication
2. **"Test Form" Button**: Manually triggers form submission
3. **"Direct Save" Button**: Bypasses form submission and directly calls the update function
4. **"Save Changes" Button**: Normal form submission (the one that's not working)

### **Expected Behavior:**

- **"Test DB"**: Should show "Connection successful" toast
- **"Test Form"**: Should trigger form submission and show console logs
- **"Direct Save"**: Should update the assignment and show success toast
- **"Save Changes"**: Should work the same as "Direct Save"

## üö® **Common Issues and Solutions**

### **Issue 1: Form Not Submitting**
**Symptoms:** No console logs when clicking "Save Changes"
**Solution:** 
- Check if form has proper `onSubmit` handler
- Verify button has `type="submit"`
- Check for JavaScript errors

### **Issue 2: Form Submission Blocked**
**Symptoms:** Console shows "Form submitted!" but no further logs
**Solution:**
- Check if `e.preventDefault()` is being called
- Verify form validation is not blocking submission
- Check for form errors

### **Issue 3: Database Connection Issues**
**Symptoms:** "Test DB" button shows error
**Solution:**
- Check Supabase configuration
- Verify authentication
- Check network connectivity

### **Issue 4: Permission Denied**
**Symptoms:** Console shows RLS policy violation
**Solution:**
- Verify user is instructor of the course
- Check RLS policies in database
- Ensure assignment belongs to user

## üõ† **Quick Fixes to Try**

### **Fix 1: Use Direct Save**
If the form submission is not working, use the "Direct Save" button as a workaround:
1. Make your changes in the form
2. Click "Direct Save" instead of "Save Changes"
3. This bypasses the form submission issue

### **Fix 2: Check Form Validation**
1. Ensure all required fields are filled
2. Check for any validation errors
3. Try with minimal data first

### **Fix 3: Clear Browser Cache**
1. Clear browser cache and cookies
2. Refresh the page
3. Try again

### **Fix 4: Check Console Errors**
1. Look for any JavaScript errors in console
2. Check for network errors
3. Verify all imports are working

## üìã **Testing Checklist**

- [ ] **Form Submission**: Does clicking "Save Changes" show console logs?
- [ ] **Test Form**: Does "Test Form" button work?
- [ ] **Direct Save**: Does "Direct Save" button work?
- [ ] **Database**: Does "Test DB" button work?
- [ ] **Console**: Are there any JavaScript errors?
- [ ] **Network**: Are there any network errors?
- [ ] **Authentication**: Is user properly logged in?

## üéØ **Expected Results**

When working correctly:
1. **"Save Changes"** should show console logs and update the assignment
2. **"Test Form"** should trigger the same form submission
3. **"Direct Save"** should update the assignment directly
4. **"Test DB"** should show successful connection
5. **Success toast** should appear when assignment is updated
6. **Assignment list** should refresh with updated data

## üöÄ **If All Tests Pass**

If the "Direct Save" button works but "Save Changes" doesn't:
- The issue is with form submission
- Use "Direct Save" as a workaround
- The database and authentication are working correctly

If the "Direct Save" button doesn't work:
- The issue is with database connection or permissions
- Check the "Test DB" button results
- Verify authentication and RLS policies

## üìû **Next Steps**

After running these tests:
1. **Report which buttons work and which don't**
2. **Share any console error messages**
3. **Note any specific error patterns**
4. **Check if the issue is form submission or database related**

This comprehensive testing will help identify exactly where the issue occurs in the save process.
