# 🔔 Notification System for Your Actual Database Schema

## ✅ **Perfect Integration with Your Schema**

I've created a comprehensive notification system that works seamlessly with your actual database structure. Here's how it integrates with your existing tables:

## 🗄️ **Your Database Schema Integration**

### **Core Tables Used:**
- **`profiles`** - User information with roles (student/faculty)
- **`courses`** - Course information with instructor_id
- **`assignments`** - Assignment details linked to courses
- **`quizzes`** - Quiz details linked to courses
- **`enrollments`** - Student course enrollments
- **`assignment_submissions`** - Student assignment submissions
- **`quiz_attempts`** - Student quiz attempts
- **`notifications`** - Enhanced with additional foreign keys

### **Enhanced Notifications Table:**
```sql
-- Your existing notifications table enhanced with:
ALTER TABLE notifications ADD COLUMN course_id UUID REFERENCES courses(id);
ALTER TABLE notifications ADD COLUMN assignment_id UUID REFERENCES assignments(id);
ALTER TABLE notifications ADD COLUMN quiz_id UUID REFERENCES quizzes(id);
ALTER TABLE notifications ADD COLUMN enrollment_id UUID REFERENCES enrollments(id);
ALTER TABLE notifications ADD COLUMN submission_id UUID REFERENCES assignment_submissions(id);
ALTER TABLE notifications ADD COLUMN attempt_id UUID REFERENCES quiz_attempts(id);
ALTER TABLE notifications ADD COLUMN updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW();
```

## 🚀 **Automatic Notification Triggers**

### **1. Assignment Submission Notifications**
```sql
-- Trigger: When assignment_submissions.status changes
-- Faculty gets: "📚 New Assignment Submission"
-- Student gets: "🎉 Assignment Graded!" (when graded)
```

### **2. Quiz Completion Notifications**
```sql
-- Trigger: When quiz_attempts.status changes to 'completed'
-- Faculty gets: "📊 Quiz Completed"
-- Student gets: "🎯 Quiz Completed!"
```

### **3. Enrollment Notifications**
```sql
-- Trigger: When enrollments.status changes
-- Faculty gets: "👥 New Enrollment Request"
-- Student gets: "📝 Enrollment Requested" / "🎉 Enrollment Approved!" / "❌ Enrollment Declined"
```

### **4. New Assignment/Quiz Notifications**
```sql
-- Trigger: When new assignments or quizzes are created
-- Students get: "📚 New Assignment Available" / "📝 New Quiz Available"
```

## 🔧 **Setup Instructions**

### **1. Run the Database Setup**
```sql
-- Execute in Supabase SQL editor
\i scripts/setup-notification-system.sql
```

### **2. Install Notification Triggers**
```sql
-- Execute in Supabase SQL editor
\i lib/notification-triggers.sql
```

### **3. Test the System**
```sql
-- Test with your actual data
SELECT * FROM notifications ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10;
```

## 📊 **Notification Types & Examples**

### **For Faculty:**
- **📚 Assignment Submissions** - "John Doe submitted 'Math Assignment' in Mathematics 101"
- **📊 Quiz Completions** - "Jane Smith completed 'Algebra Quiz' (Score: 85/100 - 85%)"
- **👥 Enrollment Requests** - "Mike Johnson has requested to enroll in Physics 201"
- **✅ Assignment Graded** - "You graded 'Math Assignment' for John Doe (Score: 92)"

### **For Students:**
- **📚 New Assignments** - "A new assignment 'Math Assignment' has been posted in Mathematics 101"
- **📝 New Quizzes** - "A new quiz 'Algebra Quiz' has been posted in Mathematics 101"
- **🎉 Assignment Graded** - "Your assignment 'Math Assignment' has been graded. Score: 92"
- **🎯 Quiz Completed** - "You completed 'Algebra Quiz' with a score of 85"
- **🎉 Enrollment Approved** - "Your enrollment request for Mathematics 101 has been approved!"
- **⏰ Assignment Due Soon** - "Assignment 'Math Assignment' is due soon in Mathematics 101"

## 🔄 **Real-Time Events**

### **Assignment Workflow:**
1. **Faculty creates assignment** → Students get "New Assignment Available"
2. **Student submits assignment** → Faculty gets "New Assignment Submission"
3. **Faculty grades assignment** → Student gets "Assignment Graded"

### **Quiz Workflow:**
1. **Faculty creates quiz** → Students get "New Quiz Available"
2. **Student completes quiz** → Faculty gets "Quiz Completed", Student gets "Quiz Completed"

### **Enrollment Workflow:**
1. **Student requests enrollment** → Faculty gets "New Enrollment Request", Student gets "Enrollment Requested"
2. **Faculty approves/declines** → Student gets "Enrollment Approved/Declined"

## 🎯 **Manual Notification Functions**

### **Send Course Announcements:**
```sql
-- Send announcement to all enrolled students
SELECT send_course_announcement(
    'course-uuid-here',
    'Important Update',
    'Please review the updated syllabus for next week.',
    'faculty-uuid-here'
);
```

### **Send Assignment Reminders:**
```sql
-- Send reminders for assignments due in 24 hours
SELECT send_assignment_reminders();
```

## 🔒 **Security & Permissions**

### **Row Level Security (RLS):**
- **Students** can only see their own notifications
- **Faculty** can see notifications for their courses
- **Secure access** with proper authentication

### **Database Functions:**
```sql
-- Get notification count for user
SELECT get_notification_count('user-uuid-here');

-- Mark notification as read
SELECT mark_notification_read('notification-uuid', 'user-uuid');

-- Mark all notifications as read
SELECT mark_all_notifications_read('user-uuid');

-- Create custom notification
SELECT create_notification(
    'user-uuid',
    'Custom Title',
    'Custom Message',
    'assignment',
    'course-uuid',
    'assignment-uuid',
    'quiz-uuid',
    'enrollment-uuid',
    'submission-uuid',
    'attempt-uuid'
);
```

## 📈 **Performance Optimizations**

### **Database Indexes:**
```sql
-- Optimized indexes for fast queries
CREATE INDEX idx_notifications_user_id ON notifications(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_notifications_read ON notifications(read);
CREATE INDEX idx_notifications_created_at ON notifications(created_at DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_notifications_type ON notifications(type);
CREATE INDEX idx_notifications_course_id ON notifications(course_id);
```

### **Efficient Queries:**
- **Limited results** (50 notifications max)
- **Ordered by date** (newest first)
- **Filtered by user** (RLS ensures security)
- **Related data included** (courses, assignments, quizzes)

## 🧪 **Testing the System**

### **1. Test Assignment Submission:**
```sql
-- Update an assignment submission to trigger notification
UPDATE assignment_submissions 
SET status = 'submitted' 
WHERE id = 'your-submission-id';
```

### **2. Test Quiz Completion:**
```sql
-- Update a quiz attempt to trigger notification
UPDATE quiz_attempts 
SET status = 'completed', score = 85 
WHERE id = 'your-attempt-id';
```

### **3. Test Enrollment:**
```sql
-- Create enrollment request to trigger notification
INSERT INTO enrollments (student_id, course_id, status) 
VALUES ('student-uuid', 'course-uuid', 'pending');
```
