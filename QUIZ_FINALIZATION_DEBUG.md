# Quiz Finalization Debug Guide

## Issue: Quiz Attempts Remain "Pending" After Manual Grading

If you've successfully inserted grades into `quiz_question_grades` but the quiz attempts are still showing as "Pending Grading" instead of being marked as "Graded", follow this guide.

### What I Fixed

1. **Updated `updateQuizAttemptScore` Function**: Fixed the function to update both score and status in a single operation instead of two separate updates
2. **Enhanced Error Logging**: Added comprehensive logging to track the finalization process
3. **Added Manual Finalization Function**: Created a function to manually trigger finalization for debugging

### Step 1: Check Current Quiz Attempt Status

Run this SQL query to see the current state of your quiz attempts:

```sql
-- Run: scripts/check_quiz_attempt_status.sql
```

This will show:
- Quiz attempt status and scores
- Manual grades count
- Which attempts should be graded but aren't

### Step 2: Test the Fixed Finalization Process

1. **Open your application** and try to finalize grading again
2. **Check browser console** (F12) for detailed logging
3. **Look for these log messages:**
   - `"Finalizing grading for attempt:"`
   - `"Calculating total score for attempt:"`
   - `"Updating quiz attempt with score:"`
   - `"Quiz attempt updated successfully:"`
   - `"Update verification successful"`

### Step 3: Manual Finalization (if needed)

If the automatic finalization still doesn't work, you can manually trigger it from the browser console:

1. **Open Developer Tools** (F12)
2. **Go to Console tab**
3. **Run this command** (replace with actual attempt ID):
   ```javascript
   // Import the function (adjust path if needed)
   import { manualFinalizeGrading } from './lib/quizzes'
   
   // Run manual finalization
   manualFinalizeGrading('YOUR_ATTEMPT_ID')
   ```

### Step 4: Check Database Directly

Verify the finalization worked by checking the database:

```sql
-- Check specific attempt (replace with actual attempt ID)
SELECT 
  id,
  status,
  score,
  completed_at
FROM public.quiz_attempts 
WHERE id = 'YOUR_ATTEMPT_ID';

-- Check manual grades for the attempt
SELECT 
  question_id,
  points_awarded,
  feedback,
  graded_at
FROM public.quiz_question_grades 
WHERE attempt_id = 'YOUR_ATTEMPT_ID';
```

### Step 5: Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue 1: Finalization Button Not Working
**Symptoms:** Clicking "Finalize Grading" doesn't do anything
**Solution:** 
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure you have faculty role
- Try manual finalization function

#### Issue 2: Score Calculation Fails
**Symptoms:** Console shows "Error calculating total score"
**Solution:**
- Check if manual grades exist in database
- Verify question types are correct
- Check if attempt has answers

#### Issue 3: Database Update Fails
**Symptoms:** Console shows "Error updating quiz attempt"
**Solution:**
- Check RLS policies on quiz_attempts table
- Verify you have permission to update attempts
- Check if attempt ID is valid

#### Issue 4: Status Not Updating
**Symptoms:** Score updates but status remains "completed"
**Solution:**
- The fix I implemented should resolve this
- Try manual finalization function
- Check database directly

### Step 6: Verify the Fix

After applying the fix, you should see:

1. **In Browser Console:**
   - Detailed logging of the finalization process
   - Success messages for each step
   - Verification of the update

2. **In Database:**
   - Quiz attempt status changed to "graded"
   - Quiz attempt score updated with total points
   - Manual grades still present in quiz_question_grades

3. **In Application:**
   - Quiz status changes from "Pending Grading" to "Graded"
   - Total score is displayed
   - Student can see their results

### Step 7: Test the Complete Flow

1. **Create a quiz** with essay/short answer questions
2. **Have a student take the quiz**
3. **As faculty, grade the questions** (this should work now)
4. **Click "Finalize Grading"** (this should work now)
5. **Verify the quiz status** changes to "Graded"
6. **Check the total score** is calculated correctly

### Step 8: Debugging Commands

If you need to debug further, use these commands in the browser console:

```javascript
// Check current grades for an attempt
import { getQuestionGrades } from './lib/quizzes'
getQuestionGrades('YOUR_ATTEMPT_ID').then(console.log)

// Calculate total score manually
import { calculateTotalScore } from './lib/quizzes'
calculateTotalScore('YOUR_ATTEMPT_ID').then(console.log)

// Test grade insertion
import { testGradeInsertion } from './lib/quizzes'
testGradeInsertion('YOUR_ATTEMPT_ID', 'YOUR_QUESTION_ID').then(console.log)

// Manual finalization
import { manualFinalizeGrading } from './lib/quizzes'
manualFinalizeGrading('YOUR_ATTEMPT_ID').then(console.log)
```

### Expected Behavior After Fix

- ✅ Manual grades are inserted successfully
- ✅ Finalize button works correctly
- ✅ Total score is calculated properly
- ✅ Quiz attempt status changes to "graded"
- ✅ Student sees final results
- ✅ No more "Pending Grading" status

### Key Changes Made

1. **Fixed `updateQuizAttemptScore`**: Now updates score and status in single operation
2. **Enhanced Error Logging**: Better debugging information
3. **Added Verification**: Confirms updates were successful
4. **Manual Finalization Function**: For debugging and manual fixes

The main issue was that the original function was doing two separate database updates (score first, then status), which could fail or cause inconsistencies. The fix ensures both are updated together and verifies the update was successful.
