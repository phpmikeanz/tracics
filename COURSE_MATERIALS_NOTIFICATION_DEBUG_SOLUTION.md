- ✅ **Notification creation** permissions
- ✅ **Actual notification function** execution
- ✅ **Database insertion** success

## 🔍 **Common Issues and Solutions**

### **Issue 1: No Enrolled Students**
**Symptoms:** Debug shows "No enrolled students found"
**Solution:**
1. Check if students are actually enrolled in the course
2. Verify enrollment status is 'approved'
3. Check if the course ID is correct

### **Issue 2: Student Profiles Missing**
**Symptoms:** Students exist in enrollments but not in profiles
**Solution:**
1. Check if student profiles exist in the `profiles` table
2. Verify the student IDs in enrollments match profile IDs
3. Check for data consistency issues

### **Issue 3: Database Permissions**
**Symptoms:** Test notification creation fails
**Solution:**
1. Check RLS (Row Level Security) policies
2. Verify user permissions for notification creation
3. Check if the notifications table is accessible

### **Issue 4: Notification Function Error**
**Symptoms:** Function returns false or throws error
**Solution:**
1. Check browser console for detailed error messages
2. Verify the `notifyNewCourseMaterial` function
3. Check if all required parameters are provided

## 🧪 **Step-by-Step Debugging Process**

### **1. First, Get Course Info**
```
1. Enter course ID
2. Click "Get Course Info"
3. Check the results:
   - Course title and details
   - Number of enrolled students
   - Student names and roles
   - Recent course materials
```

### **2. Then, Debug Course Materials**
```
1. Click "Debug Course Materials"
2. Check each step in the console:
   - Course found: ✅
   - Enrolled students: X students
   - Student profiles: X profiles
   - Test notification: ✅/❌
   - Notification function: ✅/❌
   - Notifications created: X notifications
```

### **3. Analyze the Results**
The debug will show exactly where the process fails:
- **Step 1 fails:** Course doesn't exist or wrong ID
- **Step 2 fails:** No enrolled students
- **Step 3 fails:** Student profiles missing
- **Step 4 fails:** Database permission issues
- **Step 5 fails:** Notification function error

## 🎯 **Expected Debug Output**

### **Successful Debug:**
```
✅ Course found: "Introduction to Programming"
👥 Enrolled students: 5
👤 Student profiles found: 5
✅ Test notification created successfully: abc123
📚 Course material notification result: true
📋 Notifications created in last minute: 5
```

### **Failed Debug:**
```
❌ Course not found: [error details]
⚠️ No enrolled students found - this is why notifications are failing
❌ Error creating test notification: [error details]
```

## 🚀 **Quick Fixes**

### **If No Enrolled Students:**
1. **Enroll students** in the course
2. **Check enrollment status** is 'approved'
3. **Verify course ID** is correct

### **If Database Issues:**
1. **Check RLS policies** for notifications table
2. **Verify user permissions**
3. **Check database connection**

### **If Function Errors:**

2. **Enter a valid course ID** with enrolled students
3. **Run the debug process** step by step
4. **Check the detailed results** in the debug output
5. **Share the debug results** so I can help further
