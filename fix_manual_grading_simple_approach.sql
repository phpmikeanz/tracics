-- Simple approach to fix manual grading timeout
-- This temporarily disables RLS to test if that's the issue

-- 1. Check current RLS status
SELECT schemaname, tablename, rowsecurity 
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE tablename = 'quiz_question_grades';

-- 2. Temporarily disable RLS to test if that's causing the timeout
ALTER TABLE public.quiz_question_grades DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- 3. Test if manual grading works now
-- (This should be done from the application)

-- 4. If it works, re-enable RLS with simpler policies
ALTER TABLE public.quiz_question_grades ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- 5. Create very simple policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Faculty full access to quiz question grades" ON public.quiz_question_grades;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Students can view their own quiz question grades" ON public.quiz_question_grades;

-- Simple policy: Faculty can do everything
CREATE POLICY "Faculty can manage quiz question grades" ON public.quiz_question_grades
  FOR ALL USING (
    EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM public.profiles WHERE id = auth.uid() AND role = 'faculty')
  );

-- Simple policy: Students can read their own
CREATE POLICY "Students can read quiz question grades" ON public.quiz_question_grades
  FOR SELECT USING (
    EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM public.profiles WHERE id = auth.uid() AND role = 'student')
  );

-- 6. Verify policies
SELECT policyname, cmd FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'quiz_question_grades';
