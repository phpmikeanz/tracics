# FORCE HARD REFRESH TO CLEAR CACHE

The browser is using cached code that still has shuffle functions. Follow these steps:

## Step 1: Hard Refresh
1. **Press Ctrl+Shift+R** (Windows) or **Cmd+Shift+R** (Mac)
2. Or **Press F12** â†’ **Right-click refresh button** â†’ **Empty Cache and Hard Reload**

## Step 2: Clear Browser Cache
1. **Press F12** to open Developer Tools
2. **Right-click the refresh button** (while DevTools is open)
3. **Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"**

## Step 3: Check Console
After hard refresh, you should see:
```
ðŸš€ ULTRA SIMPLE FIX - LOADING QUESTIONS DIRECTLY
ðŸš€ TIMESTAMP: [current time]
ðŸš€ THIS IS THE NEW VERSION - NO SHUFFLE CODE!
ðŸš€ ULTRA DEBUG - QUESTIONS FROM DATABASE: [4 questions]
```

## Step 4: If Still Not Working
1. **Close the browser completely**
2. **Reopen the browser**
3. **Navigate to the quiz page**

## Expected Result
- **No more "Filtered out undefined questions after shuffle" messages**
- **All 4 questions should be visible**
- **Console should show the new debug messages**

The issue is browser caching - the old code with shuffle functions is still running.
